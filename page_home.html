        <h2>Title 2</h2>
        <p>Street photography allows me to capture candid, spontaneous moments that tell a story. I focus on the life,
            energy, and character of urban environments, bringing out details that might otherwise go unnoticed. Whether
            it’s people, architecture, or daily life, I aim to create images that feel alive and authentic.</p>

            outdoor settings.
